        <p>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for women's education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate.

            advocacy of girls' education.
            Malala founded the Malala Fund, which works to secure education for girls in underprivileged communities.
            She has authored two books, including the international bestseller "I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who
            Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban."</p>
        <p>Malala continues to be a powerful voice for human rights and education, and has been recognized with numerous
